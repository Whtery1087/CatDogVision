# Cat Dog Vision

CatDogVision is a project focused on recognizing images of dogs and cats using a neural network. This project was created for fun and educational purposes.

The goal of this project is to develop a deep learning model that can classify images as either "dog" or "cat" with high accuracy. It serves as a great opportunity to learn about neural networks and image classification.

> **Note:** For relatively good results, it is recommended to train the model for around 100 epochs.

## 🔨 Requirements

- Python **Min. 3.9 - Max. 3.11** (⚠️ Hardlimit)
## 😊 Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Ensure you have **Python 3.11** or lower installed.

3. Install the necessary dependencies by running the following command:

- `pip install -r requirements.txt` - Install all required libraries.
- `python train.py` - Train your model.
- `python test.py` - Test your model.
- `pip freeze > requirements.txt` - generate new requirements.txt (ONLY FOR CONTRIBUTORS)

4. You can now start working with the project.

## 💡 Usage

1. Make sure to have your dataset of dog and cat images in the "data/train" directory.

2. Customize the neural network model in the `train.py` file to suit your needs.

3. Train the model by running:

4. Once the model is trained, you can use it for image classification.
